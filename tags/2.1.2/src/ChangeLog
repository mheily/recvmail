2.0
?


1.1  Thursday, May 18th 2006

* Fixed a non-exploitable memory allocation error in the accept(2) loop.

* New configuration options: --with-uid and --with-gid

1.0  Friday, December 3rd 2005

* Make the stream I/O respect the config.max_message_bytes limit.

* Rewrote parse_address() to be half as large, more strict, and less ugly.

* Changed the default GID from `_recvmail' to `vmail' to allow other programs
  (e.g. imapd) to share the same group.

* New stack-based string library functions: strpnew, strpcpy, strpcat, strprintf

* New throwf() function accepts format strings when throwing an exception.

* New ethrowf() function prints errno along with a formatted exception string.

* New configuration option 'log_level' controls verbosity of logging.

* New command line options for mailuser(1) including password, uid, and gid.

* New command line option '-d' sets the new system root for chroot(1).

* New command line option '-t' enables POSIX threading.

* New (sort of) command line option '-s' enables stealth mode.

* mailuser(1) now creates or modifies /var/mail/etc/passwd.

* Converted unused function get_mailbox_owner() into get_file_owner()

* Removed SpamAssassin client code and created skeleton of scanmail(1) program.

* Removed whole-message buffering code.

* Use symbolic UID and GIDs instead of numeric ones. Default is _recvmail:vmail

* New abstract thread API in "thread.c" can fallback to fork(2) as desired and
  isolates all ugly #ifdef code into a single module.

* Documented the -g (gid) and -u (uid) command line options.

* New command line option -q (quiet)

* In systrace.policy, allow system files to be read prior to chroot(2).

* Use the environment variable RECVMAIL_DEBUG to enable debugging options.

* Give each connection a separate logfile in /var/mail/log/log.<1.2.3.4>

* New filesystem layout: /var/mail/{bin,etc,log,store,spool}

* Removed the enable-recvmail script and moved it to the main OpenMTA source directory

* Improved mailuser(1) now generates MHS-compliant mailboxes with proper permissions.

* Split the doc/index.html page into multiple pages.

* Split util.c into exception.h, syslog.h, strlib.h

* Combined elements of util.c and libsmtpd.c to form server.c

* Improved valid_domain(), valid_address(), and valid_mail_addr().

* New function file_exists() checks for operating system errors when calling stat(2).

* Removed util.c, renaming it to file.c.

* Don't allow special characters ([/`{}|]) in email usernames.
  
* Fixed valid_filename() to accept numbers in the filename.

* Fixed parse_smtp_data() in the case of dot-stuffed lines.

* Only use static linking when systrace(1) is available.

* Don't include t/ lib/ or ports/ in the source tarball. These are somewhat broken.

0.9  Sun Nov 27 15:21:11 EST 2005

* New utility 'mailuser' for creating and removing mailboxes

* Don't use -pedantic and --std=c99 in CFLAGS

* Run under systrace by default. Tested on OpenBSD.

* Include enable-recvmail script for OpenBSD.

* Created OpenBSD packaging infrastructure in /usr/ports

* Finished implementing "stealth mode" and make it the default.

* Use a single global config struct instead of multiple individual variables.

* Added an experimental multi-threaded process model (-DMULTITHREADED)

* Imported smtpsend from the smtp-benchmark project, replacing smtp-benchmark.pl

* Allow non-privileged users to run recvmail(1) for debugging purposes

* Removed the session counter code; there are now no limits on connections.

* Removed the spooling code; now use streaming I/O operations.

* Write the message data directly to the destination file instead of using
  a temporary buffer. 

* Use waitpid(2) to clean up zombies instead of SIG_IGN, which was non-portable.

0.8	 Sun Nov  6 19:07:13 EST 2005

* [SECURITY FIX] Always perform a chroot(2) call. 
  Previous versions of recvmail would always silently fail to perform a chroot(2) call,
  causing the daemon to operate with full access to the filesystem.

* Do not permit maildir pathnames to be '.' or '..'   

* Force synchronous I/O by adding a fsync(2) call after closing the message file.

* Remove unused functions mask_signals() and unmask_signals().

* Build a staticly linked binary and enable all compiler warnings

* Include a systrace(1) policy that prevents the daemon from reading any files.


0.7 October 25th, 2005

* Massive, massive rewrite and overhaul. Extensively audited, tested, and
  re-tested. This is "the good one".

0.6 June 3rd, 2005

* Call signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN) to prevent zombies from arising.


0.5  June 2nd, 2005

* Improved the systrace policy

* Remove throttle.c and related throttling code since pf(4) now supports
  max-src-conn-rate option.

* Updated configure script to Autoperl 1.24

* EHLO response ends with "250 8BITMIME" instead of "250-8BITMIME" to be
  more conformant and to prevent Postfix from timing out

* Permit, but ignore, SIZE declarations in RCPT commands. 

* Add '-n' option to advertise a specific hostname during EHLO/HELO


0.4  May 4th, 2005

* Fix OpenBSD package installer when _recvmail uid/gid exists in the system
* Removed pkg/ directory and use Autoperl to generate OpenBSD package
* Upgraded autoperl to version 1.03pre

0.3  April 9th 2005

* Switched from Autoconf/Automake to Autoperl
* Tested with OpenBSD/amd64; a few fixups made
* Workaround: Disabled setrlimit() calls

0.1  March 27th 2005 

* First public release

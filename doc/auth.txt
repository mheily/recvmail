Authentication
---

Authentication is needed in several places:

  1. Authenticated SMTP clients can relay messages to other mailsystems
  1. Authenticated and authorized users can administer recvmail via HTTP(s)

Authentication is handled by a coprocess that runs as root outside the
chroot jail. 

If authentication is enabled, a coprocess is launched that communicates
with the main process via a socketpair(2). Communication with the coprocess
uses the following simple protocol:

Client request:

    <username>\n
    <password>\n

Server response:

    <result code>\n

The result codes are:

    AUTH_SUCCESS        Username and password matched
    AUTH_NOT_FOUND      Username not found
    AUTH_FAIL           Password mismatch
    AUTH_ERROR          Internal error in the auth coprocess
    AUTH_RETRY          Too many failures for this account, try again later

The actual authentication is performed by PAM or OpenPAM.

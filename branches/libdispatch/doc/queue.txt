Queue design
------------

qdir: /srv/mail/queue/{new,cur,tmp}

each message in the queue is encapsulated with another set of headers.
each message contains the following SMTP header lines at the
top:

X-Recvmail-Version: 1
X-Recieved-Time: 1246503073
X-SMTP-Envelope: BEGIN
X-SMTP-MAIL-FROM: address@domain.com
X-SMTP-RCPT-TO: recipient1@other.domain.com
X-SMTP-RCPT-TO: recipient2@other.domain.com
X-SMTP-Envelope: END
<CRLF>
<original message follows>

Queue ID

The queue ID is the maildir message filename.

Aging / Retries

A separate linked list of 

Dequeuing

When the program starts, each message in the queue will be processed.
For each message in the queue

 - Check the Recvmail API version
 - Parse the headers 
 - If the message is too old to retry, bounce it.
 - Contact the remote MTA
 

Bounces
=======

Recvmail avoids bouncing by keeping the client online until the message is 
accepted by the remote MTA. E.g. a conversation might look like this:

Client connects to mx1.foo.com and submits a message:

                    HELO smtp.smith.com
                    MAIL FROM:joe@smith.com
                    RCPT TO:bob@foo.com
                    DATA
                    Subject: Hello
                    .

If mail for bob is forwarded to another system (e.g. bobfoo@gmail.com),
Recvmail will connect to the remote MX and submit the message.

        HELO mx1.foo.com
        MAIL FROM:joe@smith.com
        RCPT TO:bobfoo@gmail.com
        DATA
        Subject: Hello
        .
        QUIT

If there is a temporary or permanent error from the remote host, 
   Recvmail will return the error to the client.

This makes it basically an SMTP reverse proxy.
